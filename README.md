## Features

- Generate key codes by pressing keyboard keys.
- Display the pressed key and its corresponding key code.

## How it Works

The Key Code Generator application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how each component contributes to the functionality:

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page and includes the following elements:

- Two `<div>` elements are used to display the results:
  - The first `<div>` displays the pressed key.
  - The second `<div>` displays the corresponding key code.

### CSS (style tag)

The CSS file provides styling to the different elements of the Key Code Generator application:

- Styling for the result display `<div>` elements is defined, giving them a clean and readable appearance.

### JavaScript (script tag)

The JavaScript file provides the interactivity and functionality of the Key Code Generator application:

1. **Event Listener**
   - The `document` is set to listen for the `keyup` event, which triggers when a keyboard key is released.

2. **Key Code Generation**
   - When a keyboard key is released, the event handler retrieves the pressed key's value and its corresponding key code.
   - The key value and key code are then displayed in the designated `<div>` elements.
